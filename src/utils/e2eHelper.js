/**
 * This file serves as a conceptual placeholder for End-to-End Encryption (E2E)
 * within the backend system.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: True E2E means the backend server CANNOT decrypt or encrypt the message content.
 * The backend merely acts as a relay for encrypted data.
 *
 * Client-Side Responsibilities for E2E:
 * 1. Key Generation: Users (clients) must generate and manage their own cryptographic keys.
 *    For group chats, a symmetric group key must be established among participants.
 *    This could involve:
 *    a. A secure key exchange protocol (e.g., Diffie-Hellman) among group members.
 *    b. Deriving a group key from a pre-shared secret or a unique group identifier
 *       using a Key Derivation Function (KDF). (Less secure if secret is discoverable).
 *    c. For each message, encrypting a symmetric message key for each recipient
 *       using their public key (most complex for dynamic group chats).
 *
 * 2. Encryption: Before sending a message, the client must:
 *    a. Take the plaintext message content.
 *    b. Encrypt it using the appropriate symmetric group key (e.g., AES-256 in GCM mode).
 *    c. Base64 encode the ciphertext (and potentially other crypto metadata like IV/nonce, auth tag)
 *       into a string to be sent as `encryptedContent`.
 *
 * 3. Decryption: Upon receiving an `encryptedContent` from the backend, the client must:
 *    a. Base64 decode the `encryptedContent` string.
 *    b. Use the corresponding symmetric group key to decrypt the ciphertext back to plaintext.
 *    c. Handle potential decryption failures (e.g., tampered messages, incorrect key).
 *
 * Backend-Side Role regarding E2E:
 * The Express.js backend for this application performs NO encryption or decryption of message content.
 * It treats the `encryptedContent` field as an opaque string/blob.
 *
 * This means:
 * - The `messageService` and WebSocket handling will store and relay `encryptedContent`
 *   exactly as received from the client.
 * - The backend cannot read, modify, or process the plaintext of messages.
 * - Any features requiring message content analysis (e.g., search, content moderation)
 *   cannot be performed by the backend directly on E2E encrypted messages.
 *
 * This `e2eHelper.js` file serves solely to document these architectural decisions and
 * the division of responsibilities for implementing E2E in a chat application.
 * There is no runnable code for E2E within this backend project, as it's a client concern.
